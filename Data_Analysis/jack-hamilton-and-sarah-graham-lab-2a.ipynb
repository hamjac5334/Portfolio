The data had already been filtered pretty severely because the ratio of men:women was 1:1, ratio of all 4 ethnicities displayed was 1:1:1:1. After I conducted analysis and visualizations on the original data set, I had to break the original data frame into 2 smaller sub-data frames to get more insight about specific demographic groups. My two sub-data frames were: hispanic men who have heart disease, and black women who have alzheimers. From this project, we learned that finding a data set is very difficult and then you need to manipulate the data fairly heavily in order to gain meaningful insight from the data. Some major take aways include: heart disease is the most common form of death in NYC, the death rate of heart disease is decreasing for hispanic men in NYC, and the death count from Alzheimers is increasing for black women in NYC.","metadata":{}}]}
